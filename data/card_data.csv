equipment,New Artifact Subtype: Equipment,mrd,Equipment are special artifacts which may be equipped to creatures to augment their abilities,equipment.png,"Equipment are a special subtype of Artifact that are designed to be wielded by creatures, such as weapons, armor, or tools. By default, Equipment enters the battlefield unequipped to any creature. At sorcery speed, an Equipment's controller may pay its Equip cost (usually indicated on the bottom of the card's text box) to Equip that artifact to a creature that they control. Once equipped, that creature is considered the ""equipped creature"" for the purpose of any of the Equipment's rules text.",type,
auras,New Enchantment Subtype: Aura,9ed,Auras now specify Enchantments which are attached to a permanent or player,auras.png,"Formerly typed as ""Enchant {X}"" (such as ""Enchant creature""), Auras are the universal subtype for Enchantments which specifically target and are attached to permanents in play or to players.

vehicles,New Artifact Subtype: Vehicles,kld,Vehicles are inanimate artifacts which have the ability to become creatures if other creatures you control crew them,vehicles.png,"Vehicles are a special subtype of Artifact which represent pilotable constructs which require one or more driver to operate, such as cars, carriages, airships, or even mechs. Vehicles by default do have a power and toughness, but they are not creatures, so they cannot attack or block as creatures can by default./n Most vehicles have Crew, an activated ability, the cost of which is tapping any number of creatures you control whose total sum of power is greater than or equal to the Crew cost of the vehicle. As the Crew ability resolves, the Vehicle gains the Creature type on top of existing types and subtypes until end of turn, and may behave as any other Creature would. This means a Crewed Vehicle may attack or block, but it is also affected by Summoning Sickness.",type,

thestack,Gameplay Now Occurs On The Stack,6ed,Most player actions now occur in a first-in last-out order called The Stack,thestack.png,"With Sixth Edition, most player actions are now resolved in first-cast, last-resolved order, in what is commonly referred to as ""The Stack"". When a player casts a spell, activates an ability, or an ability is triggered, that action goes on the Stack. The player who controls that spell or ability may hold priority, casting or activating any other instant-speed spells or abilities they want, until they pass priority clockwise to an opponent. /nThe opponent with priority may then cast instant-speed spells or activate instant-speed abilities of their own, at which point they go onto the stack on top of all previously cast spells and activated abilities. Priority is then passed clockwise again. /nThis continues until priority returns to the player who controls the spell or ability currently on top of the stack (that is, until no one has any response to the current top of the stack), at which point the spell or ability on top of the stack immediately resolves. When a spell or ability on the stack resolves, if there are still more spells or abilities on the stack, players have another chance to respond to the current top of the stack as before, until the new top of the stack resolves. This continues until the stack is empty, at which point priority is returned to the player whose turn it is, and the game continues. /nSome game effects do not use the stack. Any ability (not spell) which generates mana (including tapping a land for mana), discarding down to hand size at the end of the turn, the Legend rule, and combat damage do not use the stack, among other, more niche game actions.",rules,

triggered,Triggered Abilities,6ed,"Effects that begin ""when"", ""whenever"", or ""at"" are instantly put on the stack when their condition is met",triggered.png,"Any card ability beginning with the words ""when"", ""whenever"", or ""at"" are now considered ""triggered abilities"".

combatstack,Combat Damage No Longer Uses The Stack,m10,Combat damage happens immediately at the start of the damage step and cannot be responded to,combatstack.png,"Prior to Magic 2010, combat damage went on the stack during the damage phase of combat, meaning it could be responded to with instant-speed effects.
