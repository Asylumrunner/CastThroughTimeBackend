battles,New Permanent Type: Battles,mom,"Battles are played on your opponent's board, and you have to attack them to flip them for big payoffs",battles.png,"Battles are a two-sided permenent which, when cast, are placed on the opponent of your choice's board with a number of defense counters indicated on the bottom-right of the card. The player whose board the Battle is placed on is deemed its ""protector"". Battles are always initially played on their face-up side (the landscape-oriented side with the printed mana cost). Battles can be targeted by attacking creatures in the same way players and Planeswalkers can be, and they can also be targeted by effects which deal damage to ""any target"" or which can explicitly target Battles. The protector of a Battle cannot attack it, and can assign blockers to defend a Battle from attacking creatures. /nDamage is done to Battles in the form of removing a number of defense counters from them equal to damage done. When the last defense counter of a Battle would be removed, the Battle is removed from the board, and its owner can immediately cast the face-down side of the Battle for no cost. /nIt's worth noting, a Battle is only flipped by removing the final defense counter from the Battle, meaning if an effect would destroy or exile a Battle, it is not flipped as a result.",type,
walkers,New Permanent Type: Planeswalkers,lrw,"Planeswalkers represent other spellcasters in the world of Magic, and have their own resources to manage and effects on the game board",planeswalkers.png,"Planeswalkers are powerful permanents which represent non-player spellcasters in the world of Magic being called in to help out. When cast, they enter the battlefield with loyalty counters on them equal to their starting loyalty, indicated on the bottom right of the card. Planeswalkers cannot attack or block and do not have a power or toughness. Instead, once per turn at sorcery speed, the controlling player may activate one of the Planeswalker's loyalty abilities by paying the indicated amount of the Planeswalker's loyalty counters next to the ability. If the Planeswalker does not have an amount of loyalty counters on it equal to or greater than the indicated cost, the ability cannot be used. However, some loyalty abilities have a positive cost associated with them (indicated by a ""+"" next to the cost rather than a ""-""), meaning the Planeswalker will actually gain that many loyalty counters when the ability is activated. /nGenerally speaking, although not universally, most Planeswalkers will have their weakest ability as a ""+"", allowing them to gain loyalty with a minimal gameplay effect. They will then have a stronger effect as a ""-"", usually with a cost that can be paid as soon as the Planeswalker hits the board. The Planeswalker's strongest ability, commonly called their ""ultimate"" or ""ult"", will require the highest loyalty cost, usually a cost larger than their starting loyalty, requiring the Planeswalker to be ""plused"" for a couple turns or have its counters otherwise increased before it can be used. /nPlaneswalkers can be targeted by attacking creatures that the controller's opponents control, and can also be targeted by damage-dealing affects which may target ""any target"" or which explicitly can target Planeswalkers. Damage is dealt to Planeswalkers by removing an amount of loyalty counters from them equal to damage done. /nIf the last loyalty counter would be removed from a Planeswalker, it is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. /nAll Planeswalkers are Legendary, and are affected by the Legend rule",type,
saga,New Enchantment Subtype: Sagas,dom,"Sagas represent great stories in the world of Magic, and have a different effect which occurs at the start of every turn they're in play",sagas.png,"A Saga is a special subtype of Enchantment, always associated with a great story or fable in the universe of Magic. When a Saga enters the battlefield, and immediately after your draw step, you place one lore counter on a Saga. The act of putting a lore counter on a Saga immediately triggers the ability, referred to as a ""chapter ability"" associated with the new current number of lore counters on the Saga. When the number of lore counters on a Saga is equal to or greater than the value of its final chapter ability (usually, but not always, 3), the Saga is immediately sacrificed when the final chapter ability resolves. /nNote that chapter abilities only trigger when a lore counter is added to a Saga, not removed.",type,
equipment,New Artifact Subtype: Equipment,mrd,Equipment are special artifacts which may be equipped to creatures to augment their abilities,equipment.png,"Equipment are a special subtype of Artifact that are designed to be wielded by creatures, such as weapons, armor, or tools.

At sorcery speed, an Equipment's controller may pay the Equip cost of the Equipment (usually indicated on the bottom of the card's text box) to Equip that artifact to a creature that they control.

vehicles,New Artifact Subtype: Vehicles,kld,Vehicles are inanimate artifacts which have the ability to become creatures if other creatures you control crew them,vehicles.png,"Vehicles are a special subtype of Artifact which represent pilotable constructs which require one or more driver to operate, such as cars, carriages, airships, or even mechs. Vehicles by default do have a power and toughness, but they are not creatures, so they cannot attack or block as creatures can. However, Vehicles always have associated activated or triggered abilities which can turn them into creatures, allowing them to attack or block, usually via the Crew keyword. /n Crew is an activated ability, the cost of which is tapping any number of creatures you control whose total sum of power is greater than or equal to the Crew cost of the vehicle. As the Crew ability resolves, the Vehicle gains the Creature type on top of existing types and subtypes until end of turn, and may behave as any other Creature would. This means a Crewed Vehicle may attack or block, but it is also affected by Summoning Sickness.",type,

In the case where a player would control more than 1 Legendary permanent with the same name at the same time, that player must immediately sacrifice all but one of them of their choice. /nNote that the Legend rule only counts each player individually, meaning that each player in a game of Magic may control 1 of the same legendary permanent at the same time with no action required. /nInfrequently, there are also non-permanent Legendary cards, such as Legendary Instant or Legendary Sorcery.

When a player casts a spell, activates an ability, or an ability is triggered, that action goes on the Stack. The player who controls that spell or ability may hold priority, casting or activating any other instant-speed spells or abilities they want, until they pass priority clockwise to an opponent. /nThe opponent with priority may then cast instant-speed spells or activate instant-speed abilities of their own, at which point they go onto the stack on top of all previously cast spells and activated abilities. Priority is then passed clockwise again. /nThis continues until priority returns to the player who controls the spell or ability currently on top of the stack (that is, until no one has any response to the current top of the stack), at which point the spell or ability on top of the stack immediately resolves. When a spell or ability on the stack resolves, if there are still more spells or abilities on the stack, players have another chance to respond to the current top of the stack as before, until the new top of the stack resolves. This continues until the stack is empty, at which point priority is returned to the player whose turn it is, and the game continues. /nSome game effects do not use the stack.

Commander decks must be exactly 100 cards and it is a singleton format, meaning a maximum of one of each card in a deck other than basic lands and cards which explicitly state otherwise (such as Shadowborn Apostles). Each Commander deck has a Commander, a Legendary Creature which begins the game in the ""Command Zone"", from which they may always be cast and always returned to on death or exile, and every card in a Commander deck cannot have a color in its ""color identity"" (the colors which appear on the card in any form, be it in the casting cost or costs of any abilities) that isn't a part of the Commander's color identity.
