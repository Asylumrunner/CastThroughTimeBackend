battles,New Permanent Type: Battles,mom,"Battles are played on your opponent's board, and you have to attack them to flip them for big payoffs",,"Battles are a two-sided permenent which, when cast, are placed on the opponent of your choice's board with a number of defense counters indicated on the bottom-right of the card. The player whose board the Battle is placed on is deemed its ""protector"". Battles are always initially played on their face-up side (the landscape-oriented side with the printed mana cost). Battles can be targeted by attacking creatures in the same way players and Planeswalkers can be, and they can also be targeted by effects which deal damage to ""any target"" or which can explicitly target Battles. The protector of a Battle cannot attack it, and can assign blockers to defend a Battle from attacking creatures. /nDamage is done to Battles in the form of removing a number of defense counters from them equal to damage done. When the last defense counter of a Battle would be removed, the Battle is removed from the board, and its owner can immediately cast the face-down side of the Battle for no cost. /nIt's worth noting, a Battle is only flipped by removing the final defense counter from the Battle, meaning if an effect would destroy or exile a Battle, it is not flipped as a result.",type,
walkers,New Permanent Type: Planeswalkers,lrw,"Planeswalkers represent other spellcasters in the world of Magic, and have their own resources to manage and effects on the game board",,"Planeswalkers are powerful permanents which represent non-player spellcasters in the world of Magic being called in to help out. When cast, they enter the battlefield with loyalty counters on them equal to their starting loyalty, indicated on the bottom right of the card. Planeswalkers cannot attack or block and do not have a power or toughness. Instead, once per turn at sorcery speed, the controlling player may activate one of the Planeswalker's loyalty abilities by paying the indicated amount of the Planeswalker's loyalty counters next to the ability. If the Planeswalker does not have an amount of loyalty counters on it equal to or greater than the indicated cost, the ability cannot be used. However, some loyalty abilities have a positive cost associated with them (indicated by a ""+"" next to the cost rather than a ""-""), meaning the Planeswalker will actually gain that many loyalty counters when the ability is activated. /nGenerally speaking, although not universally, most Planeswalkers will have their weakest ability as a ""+"", allowing them to gain loyalty with a minimal gameplay effect. They will then have a stronger effect as a ""-"", usually with a cost that can be paid as soon as the Planeswalker hits the board. The Planeswalker's strongest ability, commonly called their ""ultimate"" or ""ult"", will require the highest loyalty cost, usually a cost larger than their starting loyalty, requiring the Planeswalker to be ""plused"" for a couple turns or have its counters otherwise increased before it can be used. /nPlaneswalkers can be targeted by attacking creatures that the controller's opponents control, and can also be targeted by damage-dealing affects which may target ""any target"" or which explicitly can target Planeswalkers. Damage is dealt to Planeswalkers by removing an amount of loyalty counters from them equal to damage done. /nIf the last loyalty counter would be removed from a Planeswalker, it is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. /nAll Planeswalkers are Legendary, and are affected by the Legend rule",type,
saga,New Enchantment Subtype: Sagas,dom,"Sagas represent great stories in the world of Magic, and have a different effect which occurs at the start of every turn they're in play",,"A Saga is a special subtype of Enchantment, always associated with a great story or fable in the universe of Magic. When a Saga enters the battlefield, and immediately after your draw step, you place one lore counter on a Saga. The act of putting a lore counter on a Saga immediately triggers the ability, referred to as a ""chapter ability"" associated with the new current number of lore counters on the Saga. When the number of lore counters on a Saga is equal to or greater than the value of its final chapter ability (usually, but not always, 3), the Saga is immediately sacrificed when the final chapter ability resolves. /nNote that chapter abilities only trigger when a lore counter is added to a Saga, not removed.",type,
equipment,New Artifact Subtype: Equipment,mrd,Equipment are special artifacts which may be equipped to creatures to augment their abilities,,"Equipment are a special subtype of Artifact that are designed to be wielded by creatures, such as weapons, armor, or tools. By default, Equipment enters the battlefield unequipped to any creature. At sorcery speed, an Equipment's controller may pay the Equip cost of the Equipment (usually indicated on the bottom of the card's text box) to Equip that artifact to a creature that they control. Once equipped, that creature is considered the ""equipped creature"" for the purpose of any of the Equipment's rules text.",type,
vehicles,New Artifact Subtype: Vehicles,kld,Vehicles are inanimate artifacts which have the ability to become creatures if other creatures you control crew them,,"Vehicles are a special subtype of Artifact which represent pilotable constructs which require one or more driver to operate, such as cars, carriages, airships, or even mechs. Vehicles by default do have a power and toughness, but they are not creatures, so they cannot attack or block as creatures can. However, Vehicles always have associated activated or triggered abilities which can turn them into creatures, allowing them to attack or block, usually via the Crew keyword. /n Crew is an activated ability, the cost of which is tapping any number of creatures you control whose total sum of power is greater than or equal to the Crew cost of the vehicle. As the Crew ability resolves, the Vehicle gains the Creature type on top of existing types and subtypes until end of turn, and may behave as any other Creature would. This means a Crewed Vehicle may attack or block, but it is also affected by Summoning Sickness.",type,
legend1,New Supertype: Legendary,leg,"Legendary permanents represent powerful, one-of-a-kind characters, items, and locations in Magic's lore",,"Legendary is a supertype of card, meaning that a Legendary card can be any other card type on top of being Legendary (e.g ""Legendary Creature or Legendary Artifact""). /nLegendary permanents are affected by the ""Legend rule"", which states that a player may control no more than 1 Legendary permanent with the same name at any given time. In the case where a player would control more than 1 Legendary permanent with the same name at the same time, that player must immediately sacrifice all but one of them of their choice. /nNote that the Legend rule only counts each player individually, meaning that each player in a game of Magic may control 1 of the same legendary permanent at the same time with no action required. /nInfrequently, there are also non-permanent Legendary cards, such as Legendary Instant or Legendary Sorcery. In this case, the Legendary spell may not be cast unless the controlling player controls a Legendary permanent at time of casting.",type,
legend2,Legend Rule Changes To Be Per-Player,m14,The Legend rule now only checks permanents controlled by the same player,,"With Magic 2014, the Legend rule changed to only consider the permanents controlled by the same player. That is, you and all of your opponents can all control 1 of the same Legendary permanent at the same time with no consequences. It is only if one of you attempts to play a second of that permanent with the same name that the Legend rule comes into effect.",rules,chk
legend3,Multiple Players Can Now Play The Same Legend,chk,You can play Legendary permanents that share names with permanents your opponents control with no consequence,,"The current state of the Legend rule, after changes in Champions of Kamigawa and Magic 2014, is that each player may now control exactly one Legendary permanent of a given name at the same time. That is, if your opponent controls a Legendary Creature, and you could cast the same Legendary Creature, you may, and both of you will have the same Legendary Creature on board at the same time.",rules,leg
legend4,Planeswalkers Are Now Legendary,xln,"Planeswalkers are Legendary and subject to the regular Legend rule, no longer concerned with planeswalker type",,"All Planeswalkers past and future are now considered to have the Legendary supertype, and the old planeswalker uniqueness rule, which stated that you could only have one Planeswalker of a given subtype at a given time, has been replaced by the regular ol' Legend rule. You can have as many Jaces as you want, as long as they all have a different name.",rules,lrw
thestack,Gameplay Now Occurs On The Stack,6ed,Most player actions now occur in a first-in last-out order called The Stack,,"With Sixth Edition, most player actions are now resolved in first-cast, last-resolved order, in what is commonly referred to as ""The Stack"". When a player casts a spell, activates an ability, or an ability is triggered, that action goes on the Stack. The player who controls that spell or ability may hold priority, casting or activating any other instant-speed spells or abilities they want, until they pass priority clockwise to an opponent. /nThe opponent with priority may then cast instant-speed spells or activate instant-speed abilities of their own, at which point they go onto the stack on top of all previously cast spells and activated abilities. Priority is then passed clockwise again. /nThis continues until priority returns to the player who controls the spell or ability currently on top of the stack (that is, until no one has any response to the current top of the stack), at which point the spell or ability on top of the stack immediately resolves. When a spell or ability on the stack resolves, if there are still more spells or abilities on the stack, players have another chance to respond to the current top of the stack as before, until the new top of the stack resolves. This continues until the stack is empty, at which point priority is returned to the player whose turn it is, and the game continues. /nSome game effects do not use the stack. Any ability (not spell) which generates mana (including tapping a land for mana), discarding down to hand size at the end of the turn, the Legend rule, and combat damage do not use the stack, among other, more niche game actions.",rules,
manasource,No More Mana Souce,6ed,Mana Source is no longer a card type,,"The card type ""Mana Source"" has been removed from the game. All cards with the Mana Source card type are now Instants, and all abilities that ""could be played as a mana source"" are now mana abilities (that is, activated or triggered abilities that do not use the stack)",rules,
interrupts,No More Interrupts,6ed,Interrupt is no longer a card type,,"The card type ""Interrupt"" has been removed from the game. All cards with the Interrupt card type are now Instants, and now any ability which could be played as an Interrupt can now be played at Instant-speed. Both of these now go on the stack like any other Instant.",rules,
artifacttap,Always-On Artifacts,6ed,"Artifacts no longer ""turn off"" when tapped",,"Unless stated otherwise, the continuous abilities of artifacts remain active even if the artifact is tapped. For certain artifacts that were printed before this rules change whose effect was written with ""turning off"" in mind, the rules text has been errata'd to include a ""while this artifact is untapped"" clause.",rules,
zerolife,Zero Life Is An Instant Loss,6ed,"You lose the moment you hit 0 life, not at end of phase",,"It used to be that you would lose the game at the end of the current phase if you had 0 life.

triggered,Triggered Abilities,6ed,"Effects that begin ""when"", ""whenever"", or ""at"" are instantly put on the stack when their condition is met",,"Any card ability beginning with the words ""when"", ""whenever"", or ""at"" are now considered ""triggered abilities"".

combatstack,Combat Damage No Longer Uses The Stack,m10,Combat damage happens immediately at the start of the damage step and cannot be responded to,,"Prior to Magic 2010, combat damage went on the stack during the damage phase of combat, meaning it could be responded to with instant-speed effects. This is no longer the case: when the damage phase of combat happens, all damage is immediately done all at once, meaning damage is marked, creatures are killed, life totals are decreased (and increased, if damage was done by a source with lifelink), all before any player has a chance to act again.",rules,
commander,New Format: Commander,nph,"Wizards canonizes Elder Dragon Highlander as ""Commander"", a new format which has gradually overtaken all others",,"With the 2011 release of the first ""Commander"" product, Wizards has officially recognized the old player-created format of Elder Dragon Highlander as an officially-sanctioned format called Commander, with its own events and sets. Commander, while recognized by Wizards, is not actually run by Wizards, with the official rules and banlist controlled by a group of players known as the Commander Rules Committee. /nCommander is a 4-player, free-for-all, casual format (although a more competitive scene, commonly referred to as 'cEDH', exists). Commander decks must be exactly 100 cards and it is a singleton format, meaning a maximum of one of each card in a deck other than basic lands and cards which explicitly state otherwise (such as Shadowborn Apostles). Each Commander deck has a Commander, a Legendary Creature which begins the game in the ""Command Zone"", from which they may always be cast and always returned to on death or exile, and every card in a Commander deck cannot have a color in its ""color identity"" (the colors which appear on the card in any form, be it in the casting cost or costs of any abilities) that isn't a part of the Commander's color identity. Commander is a super fun format, and one that cannot be done justice in this little blurb, definitely check out the full intro to it here.",format,
infect,New Win Condition: Infect & Toxic,nph,"Infect is an alternate win condition, where if a player ever has 10 or more poison counters, they lose",,"While multiple alternate win conditions have been introduced in Magic's history, the most proliferant one is probably poison counters, made famous with the Infect keyword from New Phyrexia and later with the Toxic keyword from Phyrexia: All Will Be One. Both of these effects, among others, give poison counters to players. If a player ever has 10 or more poison counters, they lose. /nInfect is a keyword ability which replaces all damage a source would do: if a source with Infect would deal damage to a creature, it instead gives that creature -1/-1 counters equal to the damage done. If a source with Infect would deal damage to a player, it gives that player poison counters equal to the damage done. /nToxic, meanwhile, is an effect which happens on top of regular damage. If a source with Toxic would deal damage to a player, it deals that damage plus gives that player a number of poison counters equal to the Toxic number (that is, if a creature has Toxic 1, it gives the player 1 poison counter).",keywords,
toxic,New Poison Counter Keyword: Toxic,one,Toxic is a new keyword sort of like Infect that doesn't scale with creature power,,"Phyrexia: All Will Be One introduced Toxic, a keyword which also adds poison counters to players similar to how Infect, from New Phyrexia, did. The difference is that Toxic is not a replacement effect, but rather an additional effect that happens whenever a source with Toxic deals damage to a player. Toxic always gives a player the number of poison counters indicated by the number next to the Toxic keyword, no matter how much damage the creature with Toxic does (so long as it's more than 0).",keywords,nph

universes,Universes Beyond Introduced,znr,"Magic brings in characters from other universes, from Walking Dead to Transformers",,"Universes Beyond is a product line that runs parallel to the normal set releases of Magic, reserved for cards depicting characters from outside the Magic canon.

These boosters are focused on having a high variety of cards per-pack, include cards from ancillary products related to the set which would unbalance draft play (such as unique cards from the Commander decks for the set), and also have a 1/4 chance of having a card from ""The List"", a set of cards from across Magic's history reprinted and hidden in modern packs like a golden ticket. /nCollector boosters, much more expensive than any other set type, are for collectors, and feature more foils, rares, alternate art, showcase cards, and other aesthetically fancier printings of cards.",product,
